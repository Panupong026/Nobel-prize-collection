## Preview
This nobel app collect the data from the official website of Nobel organization. [NobelWebsite](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/developer-zone-2/)

## Technology used
I used react and API 
I used some locally stored fonts.

## Approch
I can grab and display the selected data from public API 

## User stories
#### MVP goal:
1. As users, they should be able to see the list of the noble prize laureates by categories
2. As users, they should be able to search for more detail by name, year, country, gender, or categories
3. As users, they should be able to click on a link for more detail about the profile.

#### Stretch goal:
1. The API sources don't provide the picture URL for us, so I would like to add the related picture from other sources.
2. As users, they should be able to use filters to find the information

## What left?
I combine the MVP item 2 and 3 together to find more detail about their profile
